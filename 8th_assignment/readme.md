Hi, this is Xu Qi. Based on my knowledge and past experiences, I am clear that I want to become an editor in a fashion magazine. I used to work as an intern in ELLE China (a top fashion magazine) website for almost one year and have some basic knowledge about how a website works. To figure out my persona and user journey map, I interviewed several of my previous colleagues: senior editors involved in fashion, beauty, celebrity and lifestyle area and HR Claire Zhang in Hearst with rich recruitment experience. Visuals and icons are used in my report to visualize it. I uploaded two versions of my personal and user journey map and hope it can make sense:)
